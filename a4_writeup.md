# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Having the program determine whether the player won lost or tied
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
The computer picks a random spot, or a more advanced version would decide its moves based on player positions
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
If the computer starts first it goes for the middle square else it goes for one of the corners. Then for each move pretend to play and see the outcomes then imagine what the player would do and base its move off that.
